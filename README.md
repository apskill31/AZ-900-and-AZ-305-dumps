# AZ-900-and-AZ-305-dumps
I have used Skillcertpro’s exam dumps for both the AZ-900 and AZ-305 certifications and found them to be outstanding. They offer a comprehensive set of questions, including scenario-based and hotspot questions similar to those on the actual exams. I was able to pass both exams with a 940 and 912 score on my first attempt. I have also used their practice tests for other exams and have been very satisfied.

Skillcertpro's AZ-900 and AZ-305 exam dumps are up-to-date, reflecting the latest exam patterns and questions. The detailed explanations provided for each question helped me understand not just the correct answers but also the reasoning behind them. This significantly deepened my understanding of Azure fundamentals, architecture, and best practices.

I consistently scored around 80% on their mock exams, which greatly boosted my confidence. The bi-weekly updates ensured that I was studying the most relevant and recent material. Additionally, their Master Cheat Sheet was a concise and effective way to review key topics just before the exam. You don’t need to refer to any other documentation if you go through this cheat sheet.

The similarity between the real exam questions and Skillcertpro’s materials was striking, with approximately 70–80% overlap. For me, at least 80% of the questions came from these exams word for word. The same was reported by colleagues who took the same exams.

Priced at around $20, these resources are well worth the investment considering the quality, lifetime access, and free updates. Skillcertpro also offers a 100% money-back policy if you’re unable to clear the exam on your first attempt.

I strongly advise against relying on free dumps available online, as most of them have incorrect answers and can misguide your preparation. I have no affiliation with Skillcertpro; my endorsement is purely based on my positive experience with their materials.
